<p><span class="rvts12">FCEUX Movie File format</span></p>
<p>designed by: Zeromus</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>FCEUX uses a new movie file format - .fm2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This differs from the previous FCE Ultra movie format (.fcm) in the following ways:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>-It is completely text based; allowing easy movie editing/splicing</p>
<p>-An imbedded GUID so FCEUX can tell if a savestate belongs to a movie file</p>
<p>-Movies recorded from Start (Power-on) no longer have a redundant savestate</p>
<p>-Can no longer record from soft reset</p>
<p>-Contains mouse input for recording the Zapper &amp; Arkanoid Paddle</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="rvts16">Format</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>FM2 is ASCII plain text. &nbsp;It consists of several key-value pairs followed by an input log section.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The input log section can be identified by its starting with a | (pipe).</p>
<p>The input log section terminates at eof.</p>
<p>Newlines may be \r\n or \n</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Key-value pairs consist of a key identifier, followed by a space separator, followed by the value text.</p>
<p>Value text is always terminated by a newline, which the value text will not include.</p>
<p>The value text is parsed differently depending on the type of the key.</p>
<p>The key-value pairs may be in any order, except that the first key must be version.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Integer keys (also used for booleans, with a 1 or 0) will have a value that is a simple integer not to exceed 32bits</p>
<p> - version (required) - the version of the movie file format; for now it is always 3</p>
<p> - emuVersion (required) - the version of the emulator used to produce the movie</p>
<p> - rerecordCount (optional) - the rerecord count</p>
<p> - palFlag (bool) (optional) - true if the movie uses pal timing</p>
<p> - fourscore (bool) (*note C) - true if a fourscore was used</p>
<p> - FDS (bool) (optional) - true if movie was recorded on a Famicom Disk System (FDS) game</p>
<p> - port0, port1 (*note C) - indicates the types of input devices. Supported values are:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; SI_GAMEPAD = 1,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; SI_ZAPPER = 2</p>
<p> - port2 (required) - indicates the type of the FCExp port device which was attached. Supported values are:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; SIFC_NONE = 0</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="rvts16">Header</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>String keys have values that consist of the remainder of the key-value pair line. As a consequence, string values cannot contain newlines.</p>
<p> - romFilename (required) - the name of the file used to record the movie</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hex string keys (used for binary blobs) will have a value that is like 0x0123456789ABCDEF...</p>
<p> - romChecksum (required) - the MD5 hash of the ROM which was used to record the movie</p>
<p> - savestate (optional) - a fcs savestate blob, in case a movie was recorded from savestate </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>GUID keys have a value which is in the standard guide format: 452DE2C3-EF43-2FA9-77AC-0677FC51543B</p>
<p> - guide (required) a unique identifier for a movie, generated when the movie is created, which is used when loading a savestate to make sure it belongs to the current movie.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="rvts10">Comments</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>- comment (optional) - simply a memo. </p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; by convention, the first token in the comment value is the subject of the comment.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; by convention, subsequent comments with the same subject will have their ordering preserved and may be used to approximate multi-line comments.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; by convention, the author of the movie should be stored in comment(s) with a subject of: author</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>comment author adelikat</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="rvts10">Subtitles</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>- subtitle (optional) - a message that will be displayed on screen when movie is played back (unless Subtitles are turned off, see <a class="rvts18" href="MovieOptions.html">Movie options</a>).</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;by convention, subtitles will begin with the word subtitle</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;by convention, an integer value will proceed which will indicate the frame that the subtitle will be displayed</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;by convention, a string of text will follow which will be the string displayed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>subtitle 1000 Level Two</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At frame 1000 the words "Level Two" will be displayed on the screen</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="rvts16">Input log</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The input log section consists of lines beginning and ending with a | (pipe).</p>
<p>The fields are as follows, except as noted in note C.</p>
<p>|c|port0|port1|port2|</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>field c is a variable length decimal integer which is a bit field corresponding to miscellaneous input states which are valid at the start of the frame.</p>
<p>Current values for this are</p>
<p>MOVIECMD_RESET = 1</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the format of port0, port1, port2 depends on which types of devices were attached.</p>
<p>SI_GAMEPAD:</p>
<p> the field consists of eight characters which constitute a bit field.</p>
<p> any character other than ' ' or '.' means that the button was pressed.</p>
<p> by convention, the following mnemonics will be used in a column to remind us of which button corresponds to which column:</p>
<p> &nbsp; RLDUTSBA (Right,Left,Down,Up,sTart,Select,B,A)</p>
<p>SI_ZAPPER:</p>
<p> XXX YYY B Q Z</p>
<p> XXX: %03d, the x position of the mouse</p>
<p> YYY: %03d, the y position of the mouse</p>
<p> B: %1d, 1 if the mouse button is pressed; 0 if not</p>
<p> Q: %1d, an internal value used by the emulator's zapper code (this is most unfortunate..)</p>
<p> Z: %d, a variable-length decimal integer; an internal value used by the emulator's zapper code (this is even more unfortunate..)</p>
<p>SIFC_NONE:</p>
<p> this field must always be empty.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>* Notes *</p>
<p>A. There is no key-value pair that indicates the length of the movie. This must be read by scanning the input log and counting the number of lines.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>B. All movies start from power-on, unless a savestate key-value is present.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>C. </p>
<p>If a fourscore is used, then port0 and port1 are irrelevant and ignored. </p>
<p>The input types must all be gamepads, and the input log will be in the following format:</p>
<p> &nbsp;{player1 &nbsp;player2 &nbsp;player3 &nbsp;player4}</p>
<p>|c|ABSTUDLR|ABSTUDLR|ABSTUDLR|ABSTUDLR|port2|</p>
<p>If a fourscore is not used, then port0 and port1 are required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>D. The emulator uses these framerate constants</p>
<p> &nbsp;- NTSC: 1008307711 /256/65536 = 60.099822938442230224609375</p>
<p> &nbsp;- PAL : 838977920 &nbsp;/256/65536 = 50.00698089599609375</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>E. The author of this format is curious about what people think of it. Please let him know!</p>
